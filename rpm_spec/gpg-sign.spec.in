%description
The Qubes service for delegating GnuPG signing.  You can keep keys in
secure (even network isolated) VM and only pass data to it for
signing/decryption.  Compared to qubes-gpg-split, this service focuses
on simplicity and minimal attack surface.  The client is required to
specify the exact fingerprint of the key they wish to use for signing
as the service argument, allowing qrexec policy to limit which qubes can
use which keys.
